# Sports Image Classification

For our project, we are creating a program that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into different sports categories. The program will be trained on a variety of sports images, and the CNN will automatically learn important features from the pictures to help it identify which sport is shown. The goal is to build a model that can correctly recognize different sports from new images, while also running efficiently.
